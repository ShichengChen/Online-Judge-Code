# Attitude
- never over-confident
  - write code fast, finish code first and then polish it
  - thinking for at least on minute or enumerate all situations even for simple problems
  - do not answer to fast  

- solve problem from the easiest way


# Preparation
- why come to the company
- what does the company do
- self introduction
- if encounter unknown problem, I can ask for thinking 10 seconds
- prepare a hard question instead of the hardest acm question.
