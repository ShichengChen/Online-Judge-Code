# How to solve it
## from method side
- write every thing you have thought on the paper.
- write a formulation on the paper and try to optimize it.
- could I use brute force
- could I solve it by greedy and dp
- monotonically increasing or decreasing, binary search
- Binary search over the answer

### For math problems
- Factorization
- Enumerate from very beginning
- try to use formulation to change the form of equations

### For data structure problem
- find the maximum value from a range, try to use set first, then for RMQ or segment tree.

## from time side
- think about the Essence of the problem and details simultaneously.
- know how to write the code for EACH step. If i cannot remeber all situtation or form a big picture, I need to write to paper to organize the problem first and then write the code.
- test it well before write code
- never submit code continuously
- The limitation of one easy problem is 30 minutes during a contest
- The limitation of one hard problem is 1 day after contests(stop thinking if no more new ideas on this problem)

# How to solve problem faster
- find patterns in the string(D. Minimum Euler Cycle)[https://codeforces.com/contest/1334/problem/D]
- read problem carefully and then read samples and explanations even I believe that I understand the problem.

# How to prevent wrong code
- Follow these steps as much as possible
	- think problem well **at the very beginning**
	- think how to write code
	- rethink problem, is that right
	- write code.
- write every requirement on the paper. 
	- understand the meaning of each variable clearly, especially, for the problem style I am not good at.
- when writing code, if i find something i do not consider before, i should stop and redo above operations.
- make variables with relations have similar names.
- use small data test my solution
- after getting wrong answer, write the thinking link on the paper and check which part maybe wrong.

## How to debug faster
- use eyes first, then use cout one or few variables, then eyes then cout one or few variables etc.

## Small bugs
- int overflow
- small array size
- what if the size of array is 1(boundary situation)
- minn should be the minimum.
- clear edge vectors

## common mistakes
- Is greedy hold?[E. K-periodic Garland](https://codeforces.com/contest/1353/problem/E)
- Should I do the operation for the whole subtree.[Tree Shuffling](https://codeforces.com/contest/1363/problem/E)


# How to consider thoroughly
- A is the aim, we may start from A, we should also consider not start from A[D. Orac and Medians](https://codeforces.com/contest/1350/problem/D) 


# If I encounter something
## If I encounter a wrong answer in first three problems or get wrong answer two times.
- relax, go out take shower or do somethings else.
- read the problem and code again.
- if cannot find the error, then go on to the next problem

## If I cannot solve the second or third problem.
- after 20 minutes, I should stop. I need to try to solve the fourth problem 


# Graph
- cycle
- multiple graphs
- multiple edges


# unsolved problem
- [CodeCraft-20 C. Primitive Primes](https://codeforces.com/contest/1316/problem/C)
	- enumerate from very beginning. 
- [Codeforces Round #629 F.Make k Equal](https://codeforces.com/contest/1328/problem/F) 
	- generate negtive results by mistake
	- watched test data
- [E. Quantifier Question](https://codeforces.com/contest/1345/problem/E)
	- understand problem description clearly
- [EXPOGO](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/000000000019fef2/00000000002d5b62)
	- all steps contain only one odd move and all others are even move.
- [Restorer Distance](https://codeforces.com/contest/1355/problem/E)
	- thinking both side from the problem(front side and rear side).
- [Count The Blocks](https://codeforces.com/contest/1327/problem/E)
	- **1**01+10**1**=**1**0**1**

# How to win myself
- never stop thinking, like workout, train my brain every single day, at least a few minutes for each day.(do easy problem such as leetcode daily problem.)

# How to become a candidate master in codeforces
 - solve lots of problems, such as do a virtual contest almost everyday
